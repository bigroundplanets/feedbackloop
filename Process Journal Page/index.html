<body>a piece of work that reflects a creative 
    approach to machine learning. This can be delivered as presentation slides or a process 
    journal. Alongside this you will expected to produce 1,000-1,500 word text that documents 
    and reflects upon your critical engagement with the process. (100%)

    <h2> How have I found working with machine learning so far </h2>
    so far as of the 11th of May I have found working with machine learning quite hard? <br>
    I find the process of classification particuarly hard for some reason I don't quite understand <Br>
    everytime I train a set it never has the results I want ? I think because I don't plan enough 
    the way to make the data clean or varied enough <br>
    Maybe I will try again until it makes more sense <br>
    I have been reading James Bridle way of being? <br>

    What are all the terms of neural networks and what do they all mean specifically?

    <br>
    <br>
    start to collect quotes about AI stuff that I agree with <br>

    <br>
    https://humans-of.ai/?img=11#5616,1516 -- -  website that uses yolo and replaces the detected thing <br>
    with an image of the thing from somewhere else within the boundary of the boxes <br>
    I find this really interesting and also amusing <br> 
    -- man says that it allows us to see how machine learnign sees - he went round taking photos arbitrarily of things that 
    included at least two objects in the COCO object list that he could remember off the top of his head <br>
<br>

    I find working with found imagery really interesting as well but I wouldn't know where to take it - kind of like just looking at loads 
    of pictures of cars <br>
    in the same way I really enjoyed the cat and dog API because of how it constantly produced new imagery, <br>
    which was novelty and I liked <br>
    relates to my fine art practice because I try to collect car parts ect. <br>
    do I want to make data sets of things I find ??? <br>
    is there an interesting car dataset I can do something with ??? <Br>
    what if I made a website about cars?? <br>

    elaboration back into machine learning outcome for murad - feedback loop!
    - need a better audio router thingy into my p5 sketch 
    - JACK AUDIO - https://jackaudio.org/faq/jack_on_windows.html
    - WINDOWS EQUIVALENT OF BLACKHOLE AUDIO OR LOOP BACK - https://jackaudio.org/faq/jack_on_windows.html
    - took me ages just to figure out who the soundcard is in my computer and what the ideal framerate is 
     -  
     - okay now that I have it working .... i tested it with GPT voice on my phone and it was quite interesting- i need to limit the amount of tokens used quite a      <br>
     which might be quite hard?? ?? ? ? ??
     so far finding working with the token system quite daunting and scary because I feel like it's going to be full of hidden costs 
     <br> 
     - do I want to try use a whisper API or just normal text to speech?? <BR> 
        whisper API isn't good for 
    <br>
    <br>
        now that i've built a speech to gpt - I don't like the logical responses of the gpt I find them annoying <br>
        and the 'creative' outcomes are also annoying - the chat tends to lean towards the same group of images <br>
        of stars and space and cosmos. I wonder if this is an intentional design decision because they are general imagery <br>
        associated with AI, it's kind of like development of technology, human kind looked at from space, human endeavor and engineering is best <br>
        in space and also in AI. neocolonial new frontier kind of thing. <br>
        I also think the voice and how recognisable it is as a computer voice makes it less novelty to talk to the computer
        <br> 
        and I think it comes across as quite cliche. and not something I want for the work. I think it's more interestinf when the sound design is more considered <br>
        and more anthropomorphised - reaching towards a kind of more uncanny interaction. 
        <br>
        <br>
        I find it really annoys me when there's things been put in place to prevent or react to feedback loops ect. like when 
        GPt was able to recognise that I was using a repetition speech to text thing to talk to it ? <br>
        It seems like they've included design features to prevent people misusing other than for chat purposes <br>
        they probably imagine this makes it better suited for the purpose ? but it kind of isn't able to break out of character <br>
        maybe one soultion to this is to try use a less sophisticated model? <br>
        makes me realise that a large part of this for me is attempting to 'break' the software - but I'm not sure what that means <br>
        I want it to do things it's not supposed to do or go on a tangent that means it exposes more of how it works <br>
        in a non friendly way <br>


        word game prompt 
        - gets it to play the game with itself after it hears itself
        - the usee of the voice mask creates another feedback loop when played outloud
        - doesn't last as long as I want it to because i need to calibrate the sensitivity and clarity of the voice mask to keep the feedback loop going 
        - this works more effectively because the text ends up being more poetic because there's more space to fill the gaps 
        - downside for one word is that it often will get missed and then the loop fails 
        - 


        next to try 
        - change the temperature of the model in the api call 
        - change the model that I call the api to - to an older one 
        - try the live whisper model - this seems too complicated because although there are two github repos with live examples <br>
        they both use node.js and websockets, which i have heard so much about but I don't think I have time to figure it out ?? <br>
        - https://github.com/plasticuproject/cleverbotfree - free alternative to chatbot api - headless firefox browser
        - https://github.com/collabora/WhisperLive - almost live whisper transcription - don't know if I would be able to put this into my p5 sketch?
        - https://github.com/alesaccoia/VoiceStreamAI - similar - uses Python 3 -based server and JavaScript client solution that enables near-realtime audio streaming and transcription using WebSocket. The system employs Huggingface's Voice Activity Detection (VAD) and OpenAI's Whisper model <br>
        (faster-whisper being the default) for accurate speech recognition and processing.
        - use the metal sheet in order to hallucinate - to see if it documents or recognises any words.
        
        - Im not gonna do these things!
        Spefcifically wanted to note how when the word count was 8 how it would cause me to try and extend mysentences to be longer <br>
        but still mean the same thing. This is quite fun in terms of interaction and the GPT 'reaction' is a really good incentivising factor. <br>
        

        TO DO:
        - copy the chat gpt code to original and write it in my own words so I understand
        - how to get a rolling script
