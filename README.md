# feedbackloop

This project was made as a tangent from 
The software is intented to be run at the same time as a ai voice changer 
where the voice changer is connected to the imputs of the sketches through a VAC. 

<h1> Voice Changers </h1>
https://github.com/w-okada/voice-changer/blob/master/README_en.md 
- this is the voice changer I use in the final process which is more reliable but uses a lot of CPU (?)
https://voice.ai/ - this is the software I used for tests, it's quite dodgy I think so I wouldn't reccomend downloading 

<h1> Virtual Audio Cable </h1>

this is the virtual audio cable I used
